# commandline-tools

A little repo for any commandline tools we wish to share with each other.
Please feel free to add.
On a mac, you can install the tools using homebrew...see [github.com/ndlib/homebrew-dlt](https://github.com/ndlib/homebrew-dlt).

## Shell Commands

* [tag-build.sh](./bin/tag-build.sh) - using next-build-identifier.sh, create a tag and push that tag upstream.
* [next-build-identifier.sh](./bin/next-build-identifier.sh) - determine the next build identifier. This is an idempotent script.
